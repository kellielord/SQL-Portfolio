# Kellie Lord's SQL Portfolio 
Thank you for visiting! This repository showcases SQL I've written during personal projects and data analytics courses. Below, I've included some of my strongest projects and visualizations I've created in PowerBI and Tableau. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellielord/) if you have any questions! 
## Featured Projects

### Data Science Salaries 2023 Global Analysis | [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Analysis%20(CTEs%20and%20Joins).sql) - [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kellie.lord/viz/DataScienceSalariesAnalysis_17263310433610/USDashboard)
- **Dataset**: [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)
- **Audience**: Industry Professionals, Data Analysts
- **Objective**: Provide an actionable overview of data science salaries by various factors, including work type, experience level, job title, and geographic location. 

The Data Science Salaries dataset contains salary data for the year 2023. In this project, I wanted to analyze the career impacts of various measures against salary, such as experience level, job titles, and employment types. My dashboard and SQL queries allow my user to visualize average salaries in the US and worldwide, identify top-paying roles, and consider the impact of remote work. 

### Superstore Sales and Profit Dashboard| [Tableau Dashboard]()
- **Dataset**: [Superstore]()
- **Audience**: Business Analysts, Sales Managers
- **Objective**: Analyze sales and profit trends year-over-year (YoY) to identify key insights into product performance, regional sales variations, and customer behavior.

In this analysis, I focused on the Superstore sales sample data to evaluate sales and profit changes between 2019 and 2020. I created dynamic visualizations that break down performance by product category, region, and customer segments. This dashboard provides sales teams the information needed to analyze sales, profit, shipping, and the year-over-year impact, guiding growth and optimizing strategies for success.

### Classic Models Sales Analysis: Regional Performance & Product Trends | [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Classic%20Models.sql) - [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEH8KPtTxuVk2v5BaW9RD5ewuMzpaKBpJbFbwCT71ys/pubhtml) - [PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Classic%20Models%20Dashboard.pdf)
- **Dataset**: [Classic Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rhettap1/classicmodels-w-sql-excel-python)
- **Audience**: Sales Leaders 
- **Objective**: Analyze sales patterns through product performance, regional sales numbers, and customer trends in the Classic Models database.

With the objective of identifying sales patterns within the Classic Models database, a fictional model car company, I focused on the 2003-2005 sales data. I broke down performance by product line, country, and city. In my SQL analysis, I identified patterns such as products most purchased together and the variability of sales value over time. Through interacting with my project, my audience can easily visualize and act on the data, driving empowered business decisions.

## More Projects
- **Python Text-Based Game** - [View](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20Text%20Based%20Game.py): This text-based game written in Python demonstrates my knowledge of core concepts in programming logic, such as if-statements and while-loops. Additionally, I show use of dictionaries, lists, and error and input handling.
- **Electric Vehicle Dashboard** - [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kellie.lord/viz/ElectricVehicleDashboard_17260145241310/Dashboard1?publish=yes): This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of electric vehicle adoption patterns across counties in Washington, USA. The dashboard includes visualizations such as vehicle population by year, a pie chart of vehicle types, and a breakdown of the top 10 counties for electric vehicle adoption.
- **Recipe Box Database** - [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Kellie's%20Recipe%20Box%20in%20PostgreSQL.sql): My Recipe Box project utilizes PostgreSQL to design a relational database that contains recipe data including categories, ingredients, and cooking instructions.
