Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of SQL projects that demonstrate my skills in data analytics and storytelling using PowerBI and Tableau. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellielord/) if you have any questions! 
## Featured Projects

### Superstore Sales and Profit Dashboard | [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kellie.lord/viz/SuperstoreAnalysis_17268536872790/Overview)
- **Dataset**: [Superstore](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/monisamir/online-super-store-sales-analysis)
- **Audience**: Business Analysts, Sales Managers
- **Objective**: Analyze sales and profit trends year-over-year (YoY) to identify key insights into product performance, regional sales variations, and customer behavior.

In this analysis, I focused on the Superstore sales sample data to evaluate sales and profit changes between 2019 and 2020. I created dynamic visualizations that break down performance by product category, region, and customer segments. This dashboard equips sales teams with insights needed to analyze sales, profit margins, and shipping efficiency, optimizing performance.

### Classic Models Sales Analysis | [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Classic%20Models.sql) - [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEH8KPtTxuVk2v5BaW9RD5ewuMzpaKBpJbFbwCT71ys/pubhtml) - [PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Classic%20Models%20Dashboard.pdf)
- **Dataset**: [Classic Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rhettap1/classicmodels-w-sql-excel-python)
- **Audience**: Sales Leaders 
- **Objective**: Analyze sales patterns through product performance, regional sales numbers, and customer trends in the Classic Models database.

With the objective of identifying sales patterns within the Classic Models database, a fictional model car company, I focused on the 2003-2005 sales data, breaking down performance by product line, country, and city. In my SQL analysis, I highlighted key patterns such as products most purchased together and the variability of sales value over time. Through interacting with my project, my audience can easily visualize and act on the data, driving empowered business decisions.

### Data Science Salaries Global Analysis | [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Analysis.sql) - [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kellie.lord/viz/DataScienceSalariesAnalysis_17263310433610/USDashboard)
- **Dataset**: [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)
- **Audience**: Industry Professionals, Data Analysts
- **Objective**: Provide an actionable overview of data science salaries by various factors, including work type, experience level, job title, and geographic location. 

The Data Science Salaries dataset contains salary data for the year 2023. In this project, I wanted to analyze the career impacts of various factors against salary, such as experience level, job titles, and employment types. The dashboard and SQL queries help users visualize average salaries in the US and globally, identify top-paying roles, and assess the impact of remote work.
