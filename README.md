# Kellie Lord's SQL Portfolio 
Thank you for visiting! This repository showcases SQL I've written during personal projects and data analytics courses. Below, I've included some of my strongest projects and visualizations I've created in PowerBI and Tableau.

### Classic Models Sales Overview [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Classic%20Models.sql) - [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEH8KPtTxuVk2v5BaW9RD5ewuMzpaKBpJbFbwCT71ys/pubhtml) - [PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Classic%20Models%20Dashboard.pdf)
- **Dataset**: Classic Models database, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rhettap1/classicmodels-w-sql-excel-python)
- **Audience**: Sales Leaders 
- **Objective**: Analyze sales patterns through product performance, regional sales numbers, and customer trends in the Classic Models database

With the objective of investigating hidden sales patterns within the Classic Models database, I conducted a complete analysis of the 2003-2005 sales data. I focused on breaking down product performance by product line, country, and city â€” providing clear, applicable insights into the most valuable regions and product categories. During my analysis, I identified key patterns that could impact sales decisions, such as products most purchased together and the fluctuation of sales value over time. Through interacting with my project, my audience can easily visualize and act on the data, driving empowered business decisions.
