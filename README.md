# Kellie Lord's SQL Portfolio 
Thank you for visiting! This repository showcases SQL I've written during personal projects and data analytics courses. Below, I've included some of my strongest projects and visualizations I've created in PowerBI and Tableau. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellielord/) if you have any questions! 
## Featured Projects

### Global Data Science Salaries Analysis [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Analysis%20(CTEs%20and%20Joins).sql) - [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kellie.lord/viz/DataScienceSalariesAnalysis_17263310433610/USDashboard)
- **Dataset**: [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)
- **Audience**: Industry Professionals, Data Analysts
- **Objective**: Provide an actionable overview of data science salaries by various factors, including work type, experience level, job title, and geographic location. 

Curious about global data science salary trends and their potential career impact, I conducted an in-depth analysis of salaries by experience level, job title, and employment type for 2023. This dashboard provides a comparative view of average salaries across the globe and in the US, featuring the top 10 highest paying roles and the impact of remote work. The analysis was supported by SQL queries that identified top job titles and their global counterparts, average salaries by company size, and regional salary data, offering clear insights into both global and national industry trends.

### Classic Models Sales Overview [SQL](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Classic%20Models.sql) - [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEH8KPtTxuVk2v5BaW9RD5ewuMzpaKBpJbFbwCT71ys/pubhtml) - [PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/kellielord/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Classic%20Models%20Dashboard.pdf)
- **Dataset**: [Classic Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rhettap1/classicmodels-w-sql-excel-python)
- **Audience**: Sales Leaders 
- **Objective**: Analyze sales patterns through product performance, regional sales numbers, and customer trends in the Classic Models database.

With the objective of investigating hidden sales patterns within the Classic Models database, I conducted a complete analysis of the 2003-2005 sales data. I focused on breaking down product performance by product line, country, and city â€” providing clear, applicable insights into the most valuable regions and product categories. During my SQL analysis, I identified key patterns that could impact sales decisions, such as products most purchased together and the fluctuation of sales value over time. Through interacting with my project, my audience can easily visualize and act on the data, driving empowered business decisions.
